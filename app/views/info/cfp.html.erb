<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Do you have something you want to share? A controversial idea, an interesting experience or something you have learnt
  lately? Submit your abstract before <%= Dates::CFP_TUTORIAL_ENDS.strftime('%e %B') %> and get a chance to be part of a great team of speakers at
  Booster <%= Dates::CONFERENCE_YEAR %>. All speakers get free or discounted admission to the conference and
  conference dinner, as well as a special speaker's dinner.
</p>
<p>
  By filling out this form, your abstract for a lightning talk, short talk or workshop will be added to the list of
  suggestions for this year's conference. You may change the content of your abstract at any time during the period
  that the CfP is open. Everyone will be able to see your suggestion as soon as it is registered.

<h3>Topics</h3>
<p>
  These are some of the topics the committee have in mind for this year's conference, but do not feel constrained by
  them. We would like you to send in an abstract about any (IT-related) topic you really care about! Your audience will
  probably be developers, architects, testers/test managers and/or project managers, but you will not have to cater
  to all audiences at once.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming. Anything about writing code better.</li>
  <li>Testing. How do we ensure the quality of the things we make?</li>
  <li>Process and leadership. Thoughts, methods and techniques to help us build and run great teams that deliver.</li>
  <li>Front-end. HTML, SVG, SASS, JavaScript - if these are in your day-to-day vocabulary we want to hear how you do it.</li>
  <li>UX. We are still working out how to make software for humans. Help!</li>
  <li>Entrepreneurship. Finding an idea, refining it, building it and doing it all over again.</li>
  <li>Security. The world isn't all rainbows and unicorns, a healthy dose of paranoia and some solid tools to help
    would be appreciated</li>
  <li>Architecture. Anyone can write a few lines of code, but how to get them to stick together in coherent, useful and
    orderly way?</li>
  <li>Devops. Tools and techniques to deal with both the tech and people sides of devops.</li>
  <li>Fun stuff. Built a robot? Made a language? Pet projects that are just plain weird, interesting or enjoyable.</li>
  <li>Anything else. IoT, torrenting, coding in schools - as long as it is sort of related to software we're interested.
    Just submit and let us decide!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The different types of talks</h3>
<p>
  Long ago we decided not to fill Booster with talks. We want you to come back to work after the conference with
  fresh ideas and real knowledge you can use, and we believe that happens when you get fired up about new ideas, and
  get a chance to work deeply with them. We have three formats for sessions at Booster. Lightning talks, only ten
  minutes long. Longer talks, no more than 30 minutes, go slightly more in depth. And the majority of the conference
  is dedicated to workshop sessions, to really get down'n'dirty and pick up new skills.
</p>

<h4>Lightning talks</h4>
<p>
  A lightning talk is 10 minutes long and is a great way to convey an insight, suggest an idea, or share your enthusiasm
  about a particular technology or method. Lightning talks are usually well-rehearsed, focused on a single thing and
  packed with useful information.
</p>
<h4>Short talks</h4>
<p>
  A short talk is a 30 minute exploration of a subject, for a topic that is longer than a lightning talk but unsuited for
  a workshop. Great for things like experience reports.
</p>
<h4>Workshops</h4>
<p>
  A workshop can be short (1.5 hrs), half-day (3 hrs) or full-day (4.5 hrs). You work with a small group of people who
  want to learn a particular technology or method that you know well. Workshops are interactive and hands-on, and
  focused on learning by doing.
</p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Getting a forum</strong> to present and discuss your ideas with other smart people.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving money.</strong> If you get a lightning or short talk abstract accepted, you will get 50 % off
      the price of a full price ticket. If you get a workshop accepted, you will get a free ticket.</li>
    <li><strong>Eternal glory!</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  We are not able to cover travel and accommodation for all speakers. However, if monetary concerns makes it difficult
  for you to present at Booster, you should apply for reimbursement when submitting your proposal.
  Our <%= link_to "monetary policy", info_monetary_policy_path %> has all the details.
