    <h2>Thank you for registering!</h2>

  <p>
    We've now registered <%= @invoice.registrations.count %> tickets for you. They have been assigned to the following
    email addresses:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <% @invoice.registrations.each do |registration| %>
        <li><%= registration.user.email %> (<%= registration.ticket_description %> - NOK <%= registration.ticket_price %>)</li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>This invoice has a total of NOK <%= @invoice.total %> (excluding VAT).</strong></p>

  <p>If not already registered, they will each have received an email with instructions for completing the registrations.</p>

  <p>We have also prepared an invoice that will be sent soon by <%= @invoice.email.present? ? "email" : "snail mail" %>
    to the address <b><%= @invoice.email.present? ? @invoice.email : @invoice.adress %></b>.
  </p>

  <% if @invoice.your_reference.present? %>
    <p>
      The invoice is marked "<%= @invoice.your_reference %>".
    </p>
  <% end %>
