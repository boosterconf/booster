<h2>Thank you for registering!</h2>

  We've now registered <%= @invoice.registrations.count %> tickets for you. They have been assigned to the following
  email addresses:

<ul>
  <% @invoice.registrations.each do |registration| %>
      <li><%= registration.user.email %> (<%= registration.ticket_description %> - NOK <%= registration.ticket_price %>)</li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
<p><strong>This invoice has a total of NOK <%= @invoice.total %> (excluding VAT).</strong></p>

<p>If not already registered, they will each have received an email with instructions for completing the registrations.</p>

<p>We have also prepared an invoice that will be sent soon by <%= @invoice.email.present? ? "email" : "snail mail" %>
  to the address <b><%= @invoice.email.present? ? @invoice.email : @invoice.adress %></b>.
</p>
<% if @invoice.your_reference.present? %>
<p>
  The invoice is marked "<%= @invoice.your_reference %>".
